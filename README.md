# bank-account-operations

## Description

A TypeScript and Node application built to specifications from Robin Lebhar's 'TypeScript (+ REACT): Beginners Guide (2024 Edition) course on Udemy. I worked through this project, carefully ensuring classes were assigned as per TypeScript best practice. This was my first time working with TypeScript in my developer environment and it was quite challenging but also logical. Utilizing TypeScript in this project certainly supported me to debug and identify errors as I worked, much improving my workflow.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but improved following review of the task in Robin Lebhar's 'TypeScript (+ REACT): Beginners Guide (2024 Edition) course on Udemy.

I strove to ensure that I completed this task independently of any internet sources, so happily made a handful of errors and enjoyed getting stuck in the process.
